    Title: Koko Eating Bananas â€“ Minimum Eating Speed 

    Problem Statement:
        - Koko loves bananas and has several piles represented by an array `arr`.
        - Each element `arr[i]` represents the number of bananas in the i-th pile.
        - Koko can eat at a constant speed of `midSpeed` bananas per hour.
        - In one hour, she can only eat from one pile.
        - If the pile has fewer bananas than `midSpeed`, she finishes it and moves to the next.
        - Given a total of `k` hours, find the **minimum eating speed** that allows Koko to eat all bananas.
